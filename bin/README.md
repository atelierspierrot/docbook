DocBook binaries
================

This directory stores some shell scripts utilities to 
manage your *DocBook* installation. They are coded in 
[Bash](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_%28Unix_shell%29)
and you may run them like:

    cd root/of/your/docbook/
    ./bin/script

For most of them, the `-h` option will show you a short usage.

In some cases, you may need to run them as the `root` user of
your machine.
